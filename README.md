# Blank Tab Generator

Simple tool to generate printable blank guitar tabs. Optionally include faint markings for regular measures, even fainter markings for beats in the measure. I threw this together pretty quickly to simplify something I was doing in Word previously. The idea is to print something you can then write on in pencil when you're figuring something out.
