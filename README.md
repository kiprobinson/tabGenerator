# Tab Generator
Simple tool to generate printable blank guitar tabs. Optionally include faint markings for multiple measures, and you can even include a faint marking for each beat in the measure. You can also optionally include a title.

I threw this together pretty quickly to simplify something I was doing in Word previously. I don't intend to do much else with this, unless I need something else for my own purposes...
